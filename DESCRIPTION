Description: Currently fully supports Enrichr, miEAA, PANTHER, Reactome, STRING,
    and UniProt! The goal of rbioapi is to provide a user-friendly and
    consistent interface to biological databases and services; It is
    designed in a way that insulates the user from technicalities when it
    comes to using API services and creates a unified and
    easy-to-implement tool to connect to biological databases and
    services. With rbioapi, You are not required to have any prior
    technical knowledge. Just fill in a function's arguments and the rest
    is handled for you. This an ongoing project. New databases and
    services will be implemented periodically to gradually make rbioapi
    more comprehensive. Feel free to suggest any databases or services you
    often use.
