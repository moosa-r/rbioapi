    Reactome, STRING, and UniProt! The goal of rbioapi is to provide a
    user-friendly and consistent interface to biological databases and
    services: In a way that insulates the user from technicalities of
    using web services API and creates a unified and easy-to-use interface
    to biological and medical web services. This an ongoing project; New
    databases and services will be added periodically. Feel free to
    suggest any databases or services you often use.
