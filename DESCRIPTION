Description: This package provides an easy, user-friendly and unified access to
  Biological databases' API. rbioapi tries to provide a unified experience,
  effortless and of course, user-friendly interface to
  the most relevant Biological databases. The end user is not expected to have
  knowlage about curl, api, http requests, and other technicalities.
  This is an on-going project; new databases will be implemented periodically.
  Do you see yourself querying data from a certain database which is not
  supported by this package? feel free to contact me and I will try to
  implement that database in the future releases.
