Description: Currently Supports: Enrichr, miEAA, PANTHER,
    Reactome, STRING, and UniProt. The goal of rbioapi is to provide a
    user-friendly and unified interface to biological databases, to
    insulate the user from technicalities when it comes to using API
    services and to create a unified, easy-to-learn, and easy-to-implement
    way to connect to biologic databases.  With rbioapi, You are not
    required to to have any technical knowledge.  Just fill a function's
    arguments and the rest is handled for you.  This an ongoing project.
    New databases and services will be implemented periodically. Feel free
    to suggest any databases or services you often use.
