<p>STRING is a comprehensive database of protein-protein interactions
(PPI) that in version 11.0, covers 24,584,628 proteins from 5,090
organisms. Directly quoting from their paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The STRING database aims to collect, score and integrate all publicly
available sources of protein–protein interaction information, and to
complement these with computational predictions. Its goal is to achieve
a comprehensive and objective global network, including direct
(physical) as well as indirect (functional) interactions.</p>
<p>(source: Szklarczyk, Damian, et al. “STRING v11: protein–protein
association networks with increased coverage, supporting functional
discovery in genome-wide experimental datasets.” <em>Nucleic acids
research</em> 47.D1 (2019): D607-D613. )</p>

<h3 class="heading2" id="note-about-species-argument">Note about species argument<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#note-about-species-argument"></a>
</h3>
<p>You can find an argument named “species” in every rbioapi STRING
function. Providing the species argument is not mandatory, but it has
been recommended in STRING API’s documentation to always specify the
species. An exception is when your input proteins’ vector length is more
than 100; In such cases, the species argument is required. Otherwise,
calling the function without providing the species will produce an
ERROR.</p>

</h3>
<p>Although STRING API resources will handle and recognize a variety of
identifiers, it is recommended that you first map your IDs to STRING IDs
before using them in other rbioapi STRING functions.</p>

<p>You can retrieve a list of interactions that the proteins in your set
have with each other along with the STRING annotations of each
interaction. You may filter the results by using required_score and
network_type arguments.</p>

<p>Let’s go back to the interaction network. As you must have seen in
the STRING webpages, STRING plots the interaction network of your
proteins with many customizations available. You can also do that with
STRING API services. <code>rba_string_network_image</code> function is
very flexible and you have a variety of options; see the function’s
manual.</p>

STRING supports Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways, UniProt Keywords, PubMed

this by comparing the interactions’ distribution in your protein-set to
the interactions’ distribution in the proteome. Read <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3531103/#__sec4title" title="STRING v9.1: protein-protein interaction networks, with increased coverage and integration" class="external-link">STRING’s
