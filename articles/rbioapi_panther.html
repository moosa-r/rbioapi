<p>Directly quoting the the paper published by <a href="https://www.pantherdb.org" title="Protein Analysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER)" class="external-link">PANTHER</a>
(Protein Analysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) authors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PANTHER classification system (<a href="https://www.pantherdb.org" class="external-link uri">https://www.pantherdb.org</a>) a comprehensive system that
combines genomes, gene function , pathways and statistical analysis
tools to enable to analyze large-scale genome-wide experimental data.
The system (PANTHER v.14.0) covers 131 complete genomes organized gene
families and subfamilies; evolutionary relationships between are
represented in phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence and statistical
models (hidden Markov models (HMMs)). The families and subfamilies are
annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, sequences are assigned to
PANTHER pathways. A suite of tools has built to allow users to browse
and query gene functions and analyze-scale experimental data with a
number of statistical tests. is widely used by bench scientists,
bioinformaticians, computer and systems biologists.</p>

and gene function analysis with the PANTHER classification system (v.
14.0).” <em>Nature protocols</em> 14.3 (2019): 703-721)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The available tools in PANTHER’s <strong>RESTful API
services</strong> can be divided into 3 broad categories: Mapping genes,
retrieving information, and research tools. Herein, we provide a very
short introduction; you can always check functions’ manuals for detailed
guides and examples.</p>

<p>First, we need to select an annotation dataset to conduct the
analysis based on it. Each annotation dataset contains a collection of
terms, where each term is associated with a group of genes.</p>
<p>To retrieve the list of available annotation datasets in PANTHER, use
the following command:</p>

<p>Depending on the provided input, PANTHER will conduct two types of
analysis:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If a character vector is supplied, over-representation analysis
will be performed using either Fisher’s exact or binomial test.</p></li>
<li><p>If a data frame with gene identifiers and their corresponding
expression values is supplied, statistical enrichment test is performed
using Mann-Whitney U (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum) test.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>rbioapi determines the proper analysis based on the class of the
<code>genes</code> parameter. Please refer to the details section of
<code><a href="../reference/rba_panther_enrich.html">rba_panther_enrich()</a></code> function manual for more
information.</p>

<p>Now, suppose we want to perform an over-representation analysis
against the ‘GO biological process’ annotation dataset. In this example,
we only provide the gene names, thus over-representation analysis will
be conducted:</p>

<p>As you can see in the above example, only a vector of gene names was
used. We can also use the corresponding expression values of the genes.
In this case, PANTHER will perform a statistical enrichment
analysis.</p>
<p>To do so, the only change will be to supply a data frame to the
<code>genes</code> parameter. Note that in this case, Mann-Whitney U
Test will be performed. The data frame should have two columns: the
first column should contain the gene identifiers as a character vector;
the second column should contain the corresponding expression values as
a numeric vector.</p>
