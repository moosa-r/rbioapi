<p>Directly quoting from <a href="https://reactome.org/">Reactome</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>REACTOME is an open-source, open access, manually curated and peer-reviewed pathway database. Our goal is to provide intuitive bioinformatics tools for the visualization, interpretation and analysis of pathway knowledge to support basic and clinical research, genome analysis, modeling, systems biology and education. Founded in 2003, the Reactome project is led by Lincoln Stein of <a href="https://oicr.on.ca/">OICR</a>, Peter D’Eustachio of <a href="https://nyulangone.org/">NYULMC</a>, Henning Hermjakob of <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EMBL-EBI</a>, and Guanming Wu of <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/">OHSU</a>.</p>
<p>(source: <a href="https://reactome.org/what-is-reactome" class="uri">https://reactome.org/what-is-reactome</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reactome provides two RESTful API services: Reactome content services and Reactome analysis services. In rbioapi, the naming schema is that any function which belongs to analysis services starts with rba_reactome_analysis* . Other rba_reactome_* functions without the ‘analysis’ infix correspond to content services API.</p>
<p>Before continuing reading this article, it is a good idea to read <a href="https://reactome.org/documentation/data-model">Reactome Data Model</a> page.</p>

<a href="#reactome-analysis-services" class="anchor"></a>Reactome analysis services</h1>
<p>This section mostly revolves around <code><a href="../reference/rba_reactome_analysis.html">rba_reactome_analysis()</a></code> function. So, naturally, we will start with that. As explained in the function’s manual, you have considerable freedom in providing the main input for this function; You can supply an R object (as a data frame, matrix, or simple vector), a URL, or a local file path. Note that the type of analysis will be decided based on whether your input is 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional. This has been explained in detail in the manual of <code><a href="../reference/rba_reactome_analysis.html">rba_reactome_analysis()</a></code>, see that for more information.<br><code><a href="../reference/rba_reactome_analysis.html">rba_reactome_analysis()</a></code> is the API equivalent of Reactome’s <a href="https://reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#TOOL=AT">analyse gene list</a> tool. You can see that the function’s arguments correspond to what would you choose in the webpage’s wizard.</p>

<p>Using <code><a href="../reference/rba_reactome_query.html">rba_reactome_query()</a></code>, you can retrieve any object from Reactome knowledge-base. In simpler terms, what I mean by the object is roughly anything that Reactome associated an ID to it. This can range from a person’s entry to proteins, reactions, pathways, species, and many more! You can explore <a href="https://reactome.org/content/schema/DatabaseObject" title="Graph Database :: Data Schema">Reactome’s data schema</a> to learn about Reactome knowledge-base objects and their organization. Here are some examples, note that you are not limited to only one ID per query. You can use a vector of inputs, the only limitation is that when you supply more than one ID, you cannot have <code>enhanced = TRUE</code>.</p>
