<p>Directly quoting from <a href="https://reactome.org/" class="external-link">Reactome</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>REACTOME is an open-source, open access, manually curated and
peer-reviewed pathway database. Our goal is to provide intuitive
bioinformatics tools for the visualization, interpretation and analysis
of pathway knowledge to support basic and clinical research, genome
analysis, modeling, systems biology and education. Founded in 2003, the
Reactome project is led by Lincoln Stein of <a href="https://oicr.on.ca/" class="external-link">OICR</a>, Peter D’Eustachio of <a href="https://nyulangone.org/" class="external-link">NYULMC</a>, Henning Hermjakob of <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/" class="external-link">EMBL-EBI</a>, and Guanming Wu of <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/" class="external-link">OHSU</a>.</p>
<p>(source: <a href="https://reactome.org/what-is-reactome" class="external-link uri">https://reactome.org/what-is-reactome</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reactome provides two RESTful API services: Reactome content services
and Reactome analysis services. In rbioapi, the naming schema is that
any function which belongs to analysis services starts with
rba_reactome_analysis* . Other rba_reactome_* functions without the
‘analysis’ infix correspond to content services API.</p>
<p>Before continuing reading this article, it is a good idea to read <a href="https://reactome.org/documentation/data-model" class="external-link">Reactome Data
Model</a> page.</p>

<h3 class="heading2" id="reactome-analysis-services">Reactome analysis services<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reactome-analysis-services"></a>
</h3>
<p>This section mostly revolves around
<code><a href="../reference/rba_reactome_analysis.html">rba_reactome_analysis()</a></code> function. So, naturally, we will
start with that. As explained in the function’s manual, you have
considerable freedom in providing the main input for this function; You
can supply an R object (as a data frame, matrix, or simple vector), a
URL, or a local file path. Note that the type of analysis will be
decided based on whether your input is 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional.
This has been explained in detail in the manual of
<code><a href="../reference/rba_reactome_analysis.html">rba_reactome_analysis()</a></code>, see that for more
information.<br><code><a href="../reference/rba_reactome_analysis.html">rba_reactome_analysis()</a></code> is the API equivalent of Reactome’s
<a href="https://reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#TOOL=AT" class="external-link">analyse gene
list</a> tool. You can see that the function’s arguments correspond to
what would you choose in the webpage’s wizard.</p>

<p>rbioapi functions that correspond to Reactome content services are
those starting with rba_reactome_* but without “_analysis” infix. These
functions cover what you can do with objects in Reactome knowledge-base.
In simpler terms, most -but not all of them- correspond to what you can
find in <a href="https://reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/" title="Reactome Pathway Browser" class="external-link">Reactome Pathway Browser</a> and <a href="https://reactome.org/content/query?q=apoptosis&amp;species=Homo+sapiens" title="Search results for apoptosis" class="external-link">search results</a>.

</h4>
<p>Using <code><a href="../reference/rba_reactome_query.html">rba_reactome_query()</a></code>, you can retrieve any object
from Reactome knowledge-base. In simpler terms, what I mean by the
object is roughly anything that Reactome associated an ID to it. This
can range from a person’s entry to proteins, reactions, pathways,
species, and many more! You can explore <a href="https://reactome.org/content/schema/DatabaseObject" title="Graph Database :: Data Schema" class="external-link">Reactome’s data schema</a> to
learn about Reactome knowledge-base objects and their organization. Here
are some examples, note that you are not limited to only one ID per
query. You can use a vector of inputs, the only limitation is that when
you supply more than one ID, you cannot have
<code>enhanced = TRUE</code>.</p>
