<p>The miRNA Enrichment Analysis and Annotation Tool (<a href="https://ccb-compute2.cs.uni-saarland.de/mieaa2" title="https://ccb-compute2.cs.uni-saarland.de/mieaa2" class="external-link">miEAA</a>) is a
service provided by the <a href="https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/" class="external-link">Chair
for Clinical Bioinformatics at Saarland University</a>. Basically, miEAA
is a multi-species microRNA enrichment analysis tool. For more
information, see their <a href="https://ccb-compute2.cs.uni-saarland.de/mieaa2" title="https://ccb-compute2.cs.uni-saarland.de/mieaa2" class="external-link">website</a> or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa309" title="miEAA 2.0: integrating multi-species microRNA enrichment analysis and workflow management systems" class="external-link">published

</h2>
<p>Before Performing enrichment analysis on a miRNA set, note that based
on your input <strong>miRNA type</strong> (either all mature or
precursor, not a mixture of both!) and the <strong>species</strong>,
there will be different <a href="https://ccb-compute2.cs.uni-saarland.de/mieaa2/downloads/" title="miEEA integrated data sets" class="external-link">sets</a> of supported
<strong>enrichment categories.</strong></p>
<p>Thus, it is recommended to retrieve a list of possible enrichment
categories that you may use:</p>

<p>There are two approaches to do this, we will start with the simpler

<h3 id="approach-1-using-the-wrapper-function">Approach 1: Using the Wrapper function<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#approach-1-using-the-wrapper-function"></a>

<p>Just fill the arguments of <code><a href="../reference/rba_mieaa_enrich.html">rba_mieaa_enrich()</a></code> according
to the functionâ€™s manual; As you can see in the functionâ€™s arguments,
you have a lot of controls over your enrichment request, but you need to
provide <code>test_set</code>, <code>mirna_type</code>,
<code>test_type</code>, and <code>species</code>:</p>

<p>miEAA only recognizes miRBASE version 22 accessions. You can use
<code><a href="../reference/rba_mieaa_convert_version.html">rba_mieaa_convert_version()</a></code> to convert miRNA accession
between different miRBASE versions. Also, as stated before, miEAA
differentiate between precursor and mature miRNA accessions, to convert
between these 2 accession types, use
<code><a href="../reference/rba_mieaa_convert_type.html">rba_mieaa_convert_type()</a></code>.</p>
