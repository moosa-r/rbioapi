\title{Get Events Contained in an Upstream Events}
\usage{
rba_reactome_pathways_events(event_id, attribute_name = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{event_id}{Reactome event's database ID (DbId) or Stable ID (StId).}

\item{attribute_name}{An attribute of the events to be returned instead of
the whole events. see \href{https://reactome.org/content/schema/Event}{
Reactome Data Schema: Event} for available options.}

\item{...}{rbioapi option(s). See \code{\link{rba_options}}'s
arguments manual for more information on available options.}
}
\value{
Data frame where each row is a contained event and columns are
  event's attributes. If an "attribute_name" argument was supplied, a
  character vector will be returned.
}
\description{
A Reactome Event could be comprised of other events (meaning, a pathway that
  include other pathways itself). Use this function to recursively return
  all the events which reside downstream of your supplied event ID (or
  an attribute of that events).
}
\details{
By Reactome's definition, Events are the building blocks of biological
  processes and could be of two main classes: "Pathway" or
  "Reaction-like events". The events are organized in a hierarchical
  structure; and each event could be child or parent to another event; The
  hierarchy will always begin with a "Top level pathway" event. Also note
  that a given event could be part of more that one hierarchies.
