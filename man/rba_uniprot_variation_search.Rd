\arguments{
\item{accession}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/accession_numbers}{
UniProtKB primary or secondary accession}(s). You can provide up to 100
accession numbers.}

\item{source_type}{Variation's source type. You can choose up to two of:
"UniProt", "large scale study" and/or "mixed".}

\item{consequence_type}{Variation's consequence type. You can choose up to
two of: "missense", "stop gained" or "stop lost".}

\item{wild_type}{Wild type amino acid. Accepted values are IUPAC
single-letter amino acid (e.g. D for    Aspartic acid) and "*" for stop
codon. You can provide up to 20 values.}

\item{alternative_sequence}{Alternative amino acid. Accepted values are IUPAC
single-letter amino acid (e.g. D for    Aspartic acid) and "*" for stop codon
and "-" for deletion. You can provide up to 20 values.}

\item{location}{A valid amino acid range (e.g. 10-25) within the sequence
range where the variation occurs. You can provide up to 20 values.}

\item{disease}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/diseases/}{Human disease}
that are associated with a sequence variation. Accepted values are
disease name (e.g. Alzheimer disease 18), partial disease name
(Alzheimer) and/or disease acronym (e.g. AD). You can provide up to
20 values.}

\item{omim}{\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim}{OMIM} ID that is
associated with a variation. You can provide up to 20 values.}

\item{evidence}{Pubmed ID of the variation's
\href{https://www.uniprot.org/citations/}{citation} You can provide up
to 20 values.}

\item{taxid}{NIH-NCBI \href{https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/}{Taxon ID}.
You can provide up to 20 taxon IDs.}

\item{db_type}{cross-reference database of the variation. You can provide
up to two of the following:\itemize{
\item "dbSNP": \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/}{NIH-NCBI dbSNP
database}.
\item "cosmic curate": \href{https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/}{COSMIC
(the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer)}
\item "ClinVar": \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/}{NIH-NCBI
ClinVar}
}}

\item{db_id}{The variation ID in a Cross-reference (external) database.
You can provide up to 20 values.}

\item{save_peff}{Logical or Character:\itemize{
\item FALSE: (default) Do not save PEFF file, just return as a list object.
\item TRUE: Save as PEFF file to an automatically-generated path.
\item Character string: A valid file path to save the PEFF file.}}

\item{...}{rbioapi option(s). Refer to \code{\link{rba_options}}'s
arguments documentation for more information on available options.}
}
\value{
List where each element corresponds to one UniProt entity returned
  by your search query. The element itself is a sub-list containing all
  information that UniProt has about that Variation.
}
\description{
Using this function, you can search and retrieve
  \href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/variant}{Natural variant(s)} that
  has been annotated in the protein's sequences. You may also refine your
  search with modifiers such as source type, disease etc. refer to
  "Arguments section" for more information.
}
\details{
Note that this is a search function. Thus, you are not required to fill
  every argument; You may use whatever combinations of arguments you see
  fit for your query.
