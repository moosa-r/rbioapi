\usage{
rba_uniprot_proteins_search(
  accession = NA,
  reviewed = NA,
  isoform = NA,
  go_term = NA,
  keyword = NA,
  ec = NA,
  gene = NA,
  exact_gene = NA,
  protein = NA,
  organism = NA,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{accession}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/accession_numbers}{
UniProtKB primary or secondary accession}(s). You can provide up to 100
accession numbers.}

\item{reviewed}{Logical: If TRUE, only return
"UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot" (reviewed) entries; If FALSE, only return TrEMBL
(un-reviewed) entries.}

\item{isoform}{Numeric: you have three options:\itemize{
\item 0: Exclude isoforms.
\item 1: Return isoforms only.
\item 2: Return both.}
see: \href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/alternative_products}{Alternative
products}}

\item{go_term}{Limit the search to entries associated with your provided GO
(\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/gene_ontology}{Gene Ontology}) term.
You can provide Either GO ID or a character string -partially or fully-
matching the term. e.g. "GO:0001776" or "leukocyte homeostasis". if You
provide "leukocyte", any term containing that word will be included,
e.g "leukocyte chemotaxis", "leukocyte activation".}

\item{keyword}{Limit the search to entries that contain your provided
keyword. see: \href{https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/}{UniProt Keywords}}

\item{ec}{\href{https://enzyme.expasy.org/}{EC (Enzyme Commission) number(s)}.
You can provide up to 20 EC numbers.}

\item{gene}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/gene_name}{UniProt gene
name(s)}. You can provide up to 20 gene names. e.g. if you provide
"CD40", "CD40 ligand" will also be included.}

\item{exact_gene}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/gene_name}{UniProt
exact gene name(s)}. You can provide up to 20 exact gene names. e.g.
if you provide "CD40", "CD40 ligand" will not be included in the results.}

\item{protein}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/protein_names}{UniProt
protein name}}

\item{organism}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/}{Organism name}.}

\item{taxid}{NIH-NCBI \href{https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/}{Taxon ID}.
You can provide up to 20 taxon IDs.}

\item{pubmed}{Entries which \href{https://www.uniprot.org/citations/}{cite
to} the article with your provided PubMed ID.}

\item{seq_length}{Refine your search to a exact sequence length (e.g. 150)
or a range of sequence lengths (e.g. "130-158").}

\item{md5}{Sequence md5 value.}

\item{...}{rbioapi option(s). Refer to \code{\link{rba_options}}'s
arguments documentation for more information on available options.}
}
\value{
List where each element corresponds to one UniProt entity returned
  by your search query. The element itself is a sub-list containing all
  information that UniProt has about that entity.
}
\description{
Using this function, you can search and retrieve UniProt Knowledge-base
  (UniProtKB) protein entries using variety of options. You may also
  refine your search with modifiers such as sequence length, reviews status
  etc. refer to "Arguments" section" for more information.
}
\details{
Note that this is a search function. Thus, you are not required to fill
  every argument; You may use whatever combinations of arguments you see
  fit for your query.\cr\cr
  UniProt Entries are grouped in two sections:\enumerate{
  \item Reviewed(Swiss-Prot): Manually annotated records with information
  extracted from literature and curator-evaluated computational analysis.
  \item Unreviewed (TrEMBL): Computationally analyzed records that await
  full manual annotation.}
