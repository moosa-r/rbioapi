\title{UniProt maintains \href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence_annotation}{
  sequence annotations (features)} that describe regions
  in the protein sequence. Using this function, you can search and
  retrieve UniProt proteins' sequence annotations (features). you may also
  refine your search query with variety of modifiers.}
\usage{
rba_uniprot_features_search(
  accession = NA,
  gene = NA,
  exact_gene = NA,
  protein = NA,
  reviewed = NA,
  organism = NA,
  taxid = NA,
  categories = NA,
  types = NA,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{accession}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/accession_numbers}{
UniProtKB primary or secondary accession}(s). You can provide up to 100
accession numbers.}

\item{gene}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/gene_name}{UniProt gene
name(s)}. You can provide up to 20 gene names. e.g. if you provide
"CD40", "CD40 ligand" will also be included.}

\item{exact_gene}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/gene_name}{UniProt
exact gene name(s)}. You can provide up to 20 exact gene names. e.g.
if you provide "CD40", "CD40 ligand" will not be included in the results.}

\item{protein}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/protein_names}{UniProt
protein name}}

\item{reviewed}{Logical: If TRUE, only return
"UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot" (reviewed) entries; If FALSE, only return TrEMBL
(un-reviewed) entries.}

\item{organism}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/}{Organism name}.}

\item{taxid}{NIH-NCBI \href{https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/}{Taxon ID}.
You can provide up to 20 taxon IDs.}

\item{categories}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence_annotation}{
Sequence annotation (Features)} categories (subsection). accepted values
are: "MOLECULE_PROCESSING", "TOPOLOGY", "SEQUENCE_INFORMATION",
"STRUCTURAL", "DOMAINS_AND_SITES", "PTM", "VARIANTS" and/or "MUTAGENESIS".
You can provide up to 8 categories.}

\item{types}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence_annotation}{
Sequence annotation (Features)} types. accepted values
are: "INIT_MET", "SIGNAL", "PROPEP", "TRANSIT", "CHAIN", "PEPTIDE",
"TOPO_DOM", "TRANSMEM", "DOMAIN", "REPEAT", "CA_BIND", "ZN_FING",
"DNA_BIND", "NP_BIND", "REGION", "COILED", "MOTIF", "COMPBIAS",

"UNSURE", "CONFLICT", "NON_CONS", "NON_TER", "HELIX", "TURN", "STRAND"
and/or "INTRAMEM". You can provide up to 20 types.}

\item{...}{rbioapi option(s). Refer to \code{\link{rba_options}}'s
arguments documentation for more information on available options.}
}
\value{
List where each element corresponds to one UniProt entity returned
  by your search query. The element itself is a sub-list containing all
  information that UniProt has about that entity.
}
\description{
Note that this is a search function. Thus, you are not required to fill
  every argument; You may use whatever combinations of arguments you see
  fit for your query.\cr\cr
  UniProt Entries are grouped in two sections:\enumerate{
  \item Reviewed(Swiss-Prot): Manually annotated records with information
  extracted from literature and curator-evaluated computational analysis.
  \item Unreviewed (TrEMBL): Computationally analyzed records that await
  full manual annotation.}
