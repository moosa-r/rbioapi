\arguments{
\item{accession}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/accession_numbers}{
UniProtKB primary or secondary accession}(s). You can supply up to 100
accession numbers.}

\item{gene}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/gene_name}{UniProt gene
name(s)}. You can supply up to 20 gene names. e.g. if you supply
"CD40", "CD40 ligand" will also be included.}

\item{protein}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/protein_names}{UniProt
protein name}}

\item{reviewed}{Logical: If TRUE, only return
"UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot" (reviewed) entries; If FALSE, only return TrEMBL
(un-reviewed) entries.}

are: "MOLECULE_PROCESSING", "TOPOLOGY", "SEQUENCE_INFORMATION",
"STRUCTURAL", "DOMAINS_AND_SITES", "PTM", "VARIANTS" and/or "MUTAGENESIS".
You can supply up to 8 categories.}

\item{...}{rbioapi option(s). See \code{\link{rba_options}}'s
arguments manual for more information on available options.}
}
\value{
List where each element corresponds to one UniProt entity returned
  by your search query. The element itself is a sub-list containing all
  information that UniProt has about that entity.
}
\description{
UniProt maintains \href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence_annotation}{
  sequence annotations (features)} that describe regions
  in the protein sequence. Using this function, you can search and
  retrieve UniProt proteins' sequence annotations (features). you may also
  refine your search query with variety of modifiers.
}
\details{
Note that this is a search function. Thus, you are not required to fill
  every argument; You may use whatever combinations of arguments you see
  fit for your query.
  \cr UniProt Entries are grouped in two sections:\enumerate{
  \item Reviewed(Swiss-Prot): Manually annotated records with information
  extracted from literature and curator-evaluated computational analysis.
  \item Unreviewed (TrEMBL): Computationally analyzed records that await
  full manual annotation.}
