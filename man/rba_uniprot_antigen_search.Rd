  ensembl_id = NA,
  match_score = NA,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{accession}{\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/accession_numbers}{
UniProtKB primary or secondary accession}(s). You can provide up to 100
accession numbers.}

\item{antigen_sequence}{Protein sequence in the antigenic site.}

\item{antigen_id}{Human Protein Atlas (HPA) antigen ID. You can provide up to
20 IDs.}

\item{ensembl_id}{Ensembl Stable Transcript ID. You can provide up to
20 IDs.}

\item{match_score}{(Numeric) Minimum alignment score for the antigen
sequence and the target protein sequence.}

\item{...}{rbioapi option(s). Refer to \code{\link{rba_options}}'s
arguments documentation for more information on available options.}
}
\value{
A list Where each element correspond to a UniProt protein (search
 hit) and Antigenic features are organized under the "features" sub-list.
}
\description{
UniProt maps Antigenic (Antibody-binding) features from different sources
  to the proteins' sequences. Using this function, you can search for
  Antigenic sequences that has been map to UniProt proteins. You may also
  refine your search with modifiers such as score etc. refer to
  "Arguments section" for more information.
}
\details{
Note that this is a search function. Thus, you are not required to fill
  every argument; You may use whatever combinations of arguments you see
  fit for your query.\cr\cr
